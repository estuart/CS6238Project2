# Project 2 - S2DR

### System Requirements
* [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) must be installed on the system that will run the S2DR servlet

### Build/Run
To build and run the Java servlet, from the project root run `gradle appRun`. That's it! The servlet is now accessible
from `http://localhost:8080/`

### Run Test Case Files
**TODO:** once we start making test files/scripts, we will need to update this to include instruction on how to run.
